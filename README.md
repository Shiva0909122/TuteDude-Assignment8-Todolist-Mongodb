### Todo List Project - Node.js with MongoDB

This project enhances the previous Todo List application by integrating MongoDB as the database, enabling persistent storage of tasks. The app includes a frontend hosted on GitHub Pages, providing an accessible interface for managing tasks.

### Features

- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in MongoDB, allowing data to persist even after the application restarts.
- **Enhanced UI**: The GitHub Pages-hosted frontend allows users to interact with the Todo list application directly in their browser.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can add, view, update, and delete tasks.

### How to Clone and Run the Project Locally

   Open your terminal and use the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shiva0909122/TuteDude-Assignment8-Todolist-Mongodb.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   ```bash
   cd TuteDude-Assignment8-Todolist-Mongodb
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up MongoDB**  
   - Make sure MongoDB is installed and running.
   - Update the MongoDB URI in the project configuration file (`.env` or `config.js`) as needed.

5. **Run the Application**  
   Start the server by running:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
   The application should now be accessible on **http://localhost:4001**.
